# Benchmark

Benchmark for C vs 20 other languages.

#### What does it measure?

- Memory manager performance
- String operation
- Hashmap speed.

These three things in one go. Critical in web application development.

#### The Task
Basically a 4 line task.

- Create a hashmap.
- Add 500,000 items 10 times over.
- Print 2 values to indicate the task was successful.

Score gives equal weight on speed and memory.

[score] = [run time seceonds] x [memory in MB] â€” The lower the better.


#### What it says :

Initially wrote these tests in 2010, when these were generally assumed :

- lua-jit is the fastest scripting language around. Almost as fast as C.
- Compiled languages like Swift and Go are x10 faster than interpretated languages, like PHP or Ruby
- PHP is the slowest of them all.

None of the above are true anymore.

### How do I run it?

```
git clone --recursive --depth=1 https://github.com/sanjirhabib/benchmark
make clean
make all
make

```
The last make command will start benchmark test.

#### Show me the numbers!

Here are the numbers after running on my old laptop. Ordered by score on the last column, the lower the better

```

#### Summary
- My minimal hashmap is not slower than C++'s map, undered_map, densemap, or sparsemap.
- glibc's malloc() free() is not slower than manual memory management.
- String manipulation is the main bottleneck.


#### The surprises
Even though I can beat other languages, I can't beat PHP. No idea why or how they are doing it.

I tried other things like caching the hash value like PHP, but nothing helped.

#### What other optimizations did you put in your C code?

There's a list of optimizations that I DIDN'T perform :

- Strings don't cache hash. Like how it's done in PHP
- No small string optimization like in C++ 
- No SIMD AVX from my code, other than what the compiter does internally.
- No pre-memory allocation, or custom memeory manager.
- Memory allocation in increased by 1 every time an element is added. No buffer.
- No excessive use of C macros for inlining. Depended on a lot of one-line-functions instead.
- Values are all boxed. Not pointer passing around.
- A runtime type-inferance is at work making the hashmap flexible for any size of data. Unlike compile time code generation in C++.
- Released all memory before exit. Clean valgrind memcheck.

So basically just a regular C program, without any specific optimization.


#### How do I build the programs?
```
make clean        # to clear revious builds
make all          # to build programs one by one, you need to have the build invironment installed
make              # to run the benchmark test
```

or, for individual benchmark

```
make cpp             # to build the cpp program
bm cppmap            # benchmark cpp
                     # `bm` is a bash file
```

Example : with rust
```
$ make rust
rustc -O rustmap.rs
$ bm rustmap
500000
val.4510000
rustmap  	Time: 2.92 	Memory: 103 mb	Score: 301
$
```

#### Where's the C code?

The benchmark code is in cmap.c

But the library is in clib/ directory


#### I want to improve on some code

Rules :

- Don't pre allocate memory.
- Don't optimize for the benchmark.
- Use strring concat or format() which ever is faster.
- Use unordered map if that's available.

I personally prefer unordered map that stores and enumerate the items in insertion order.
Which is wny I had to write my own map data structure in C.
This is not standard and none of the c++ map library support it.
JavaScript/node didn't support it either in its initial release. But later changed their behaviour on popular demand. Node mow enumerate on insertion order.
