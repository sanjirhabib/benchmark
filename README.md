# Benchmark

A benchmark comparing C against 20 other programming languages.

#### What Does It Measure?

- Memory manager performance
- String operations
- Hashmap speed

These three aspects are evaluated simultaneously, as they are critical in web application development

#### The Task

A simple 4-line task:
- Create a hashmap.
- Add 500,000 items 10 times.
- Print 2 values to verify task completion.

The score is calculated as:

```[score] = [run time in seconds] Ã— [memory in MB]```

Lower scores are better, giving equal weight to speed and memory usage.

#### What It Reveals
These tests were initially written in 2010, when the following assumptions were common:
- LuaJIT was the fastest scripting language, nearly as fast as C.
- Compiled languages like Swift and Go were 10x faster than interpreted languages like PHP or Ruby.
- PHP was the slowest of all.

None of these assumptions hold true today.

### How do I run it?

```
git clone --recursive --depth=1 https://github.com/sanjirhabib/benchmark
make clean
make all
make

```
The last make command will start benchmark test.

#### Summary

- My minimal hashmap is not slower than C++'s map, unordered_map, densemap, or sparsemap.
- glibc's malloc() and free() are not slower than manual memory management.
- String manipulation is the primary bottleneck.




#### The surprises
Despite outperforming many languages, my implementation couldn't beat PHP. The reason remains unclear, even after attempting optimizations like caching hash values as PHP does.

#### What Optimizations Were Used in the C Code?
The C code deliberately avoids several optimizations:
- No caching of string hashes (unlike PHP).
- No small string optimization (unlike C++).
- No SIMD AVX instructions beyond what the compiler applies.
- No pre-allocation of memory or custom memory manager.
- Memory allocation increases by 1 for each element added, with no buffer.
- No excessive use of C macros for inlining; relies on one-line functions instead.
- Values are boxed, not passed as pointers.
- Runtime type inference enables a flexible hashmap for any data size, unlike C++'s compile-time code generation.
- All memory is released before exit, ensuring a clean Valgrind memcheck.

In essence, this is a straightforward C program without specialized optimizations



#### How do I build the programs?
```
make clean        # Clear previous builds
make all          # Build all programs (requires the build environment to be installed)
make              # Run the benchmark test
```

To build and benchmark an individual program, e.g., C++:


```
make cpp             # to build the cpp program
bm cppmap            # benchmark cpp
                     # `bm` is a bash file
```

Example with Rust:

```
$ make rust
rustc -O rustmap.rs
$ bm rustmap
500000
val.4510000
rustmap  	Time: 2.92 	Memory: 103 mb	Score: 301
$
```

#### Where's the C code?

The benchmark code is in ```cmap.c```

The supporting library is in the ```clib/``` directory.


#### How Can I Improve the Code?
Rules for contributions:Do not pre-allocate memory.
- Do not hint to the hashmap about upcoming operations.
- Do not optimize specifically for the benchmark.
- Run on a single processor; do not spawn threads.
- Use string concatenation or format(), whichever is faster.
- Use an unordered map if available.

I prefer an unordered map that stores and enumerates items in insertion order, which is why I wrote my own hashmap. Note that this behavior is non-standard and not supported by C++ map libraries. JavaScript/Node.js initially lacked this feature but later adopted insertion-order enumeration after developer feedback.

#### What's the Design of the Hashmap?

Technically, it's not a traditional hashmap. It uses:
- Two separate vectors for keys and values.
- A third vector to store item indices linked with hashes.
- A load factor of approximately 1.
